//the parameter in this problem is queue and queue is an array. what is queue? this will be the pseudo code
//when the wolf is nearby as in the first in the array, say " get away from my sheep" when it is a sheep in the array, say something else
//filing cabinets will have folders. we dont know how many folders each file may have. it will contain x number of folders. you are looking for a specific name of the folder. when you open a filing cabinet and its not the folder, "next folder" and when it is your folder say " hey thats my folder!"
// create an array containing wolf and sheep 

//const warnTheSheep = (queue) => { 
//// warn the sheep will be the function 
//
////setting the array 
//  let array = ["wolf", "sheep"]; 
////however many wolves and sheep
//  for(let i = number; i <= number; i++){ 
//    if( legth - 1 = "wolf")
//        console.log("hey get tf away from my sheep");
